# Active Context

## Recent Changes - Code Optimization

### Refactored jefferiesdocspreprocessing.py
- Extracted repeated code into reusable functions
- Maintained identical functionality
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### Key Functions Created
1. `setup_connections()`
   - Centralizes Google Drive and AWS connection setup
   - Returns configured service clients

2. `setup_file_handlers()`
   - Handles JSON and CSV file initialization
   - Consistent file handling across processing methods

3. `process_pdf_with_pdfplumber()` and `process_pdf_with_docling()`
   - Separated PDF processing methods into distinct functions
   - Allows easy switching between processing strategies

4. `process_batch()`
   - Consolidated batch processing logic
   - Handles file existence checks, processing, and result saving

5. `main()`
   - Organizes high-level program flow
   - Supports multiple processing methods

### Utility Functions
- `normalize_text()`: Text normalization
- `is_number()`: Number token detection
- `weighted_token_similarity()`: Similarity calculation
- `count_words()`: Word counting

### Current State
- All original functionality preserved
- Code is more modular and maintainable
- Processing methods can be easily extended or modified

### Next Steps
1. Consider adding more processing methods
2. Implement configuration file for constants
3. Add more detailed logging
4. Consider parallelization for batch processing
