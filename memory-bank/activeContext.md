# Active Context: URL Text Extraction Tool

## Current Status
Initial implementation of core components complete:
- URL validator implemented with comprehensive error handling
- Content fetcher with timeout and error management
- Text extractor with trafilatura and BeautifulSoup fallback
- Unit test framework established with mock-based testing

## Recent Decisions
1. Component Implementation:
   - Used trafilatura as primary extractor for better content detection
   - Implemented BeautifulSoup as fallback mechanism
   - Created custom exception class for unified error handling
   - Employed session management in ContentFetcher for efficiency

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Comprehensive mock-based testing
   - Full coverage of error cases
   - Integration testing of complete workflow

## Current Focus
1. Testing and Validation:
   - Running unit tests
   - Gathering real-world test cases
   - Validating error handling

2. Documentation Enhancement:
   - Code comments and docstrings
   - Usage examples
   - Installation instructions

3. Recent Improvements (pdf.py):
   - Implemented retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Enhanced URL validation
   - Implemented safe PDF handling using tempfile
   - Improved text cleaning with regex patterns
   - Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies

## Active Considerations
1. Performance Optimization
   - Session management for multiple requests
   - Memory usage in text extraction
   - Response time optimization

2. Error Handling
   - Network timeout handling
   - Invalid HTML handling
   - Resource cleanup

3. Content Quality
   - Content relevance scoring
   - Noise filtering improvements
   - Format preservation options

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Tasks
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Document usage examples
   - Create virtual environment setup guide

2. Short-term Goals
   - Implement batch processing
   - Add configuration system
   - Enhance CLI interface
   - Add logging improvements

3. Mid-term Goals
   - Performance optimization
   - Proxy support
   - Rate limiting
   - Caching system

## Technical Debt Tracking
1. Current Items
   - Configuration system needed
   - Logging enhancements required
   - CLI argument parsing improvements
   - Documentation gaps

2. Future Considerations
   - JavaScript rendering support
   - Custom extraction rules
   - Content classification
   - Performance monitoring

## Questions to Address
1. Implementation
   - Optimal batch processing size
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Rate limiting implementation

2. Testing
   - Real-world test cases needed
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Edge case coverage

## Notes
- Core functionality is stable and well-tested
- Focus on documentation and usability next
- Consider gathering user feedback for feature prioritization
