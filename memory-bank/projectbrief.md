# Project Brief: URL Text Extraction Tool

## Overview
A Python-based tool for extracting text content from web URLs. This tool will serve as a component in a larger document processing system.

## Core Requirements
1. URL Input Processing
   - Accept URLs as input
   - Validate URL format and accessibility
   - Support various URL protocols (http, https)

2. Text Extraction
   - Extract readable text content from web pages
   - Handle different HTML structures
   - Preserve relevant formatting where necessary
   - Filter out irrelevant content (ads, navigation, etc.)

3. Output Handling
   - Provide clean, structured text output
   - Support multiple output formats
   - Error handling and reporting

## Goals
1. Reliability: Consistent extraction across different website structures
2. Efficiency: Optimize performance for quick processing
3. Maintainability: Clear code structure and documentation
4. Extensibility: Easy to add support for new website patterns

## Success Metrics
1. Successful extraction from common web formats
2. Clean output without HTML artifacts
3. Error handling for invalid URLs or inaccessible content
4. Processing speed under 5 seconds for typical web pages

## Constraints
1. Must work with Python's ecosystem
2. Handle common security restrictions (robots.txt, rate limiting)
3. Respect website terms of service
4. Handle network timeouts and errors gracefully
